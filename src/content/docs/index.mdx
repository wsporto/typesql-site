##### TypeSQL is an alternative to access MySQL databases without an ORM. Write your queries in raw SQL and TypeSQL will generate a type-safe API to execute the queries.

## How it works?

Having the following query in `select-products.sql` file.

```sql
SELECT
  id,
  product_name,
  list_price
FROM products
WHERE discontinued = 0
  AND list_price BETWEEN :minPrice AND :maxPrice
```

TypeSQL will generate the types and function in the file select-products.ts. Then you can import the generate code and execute as following:

<img src={typesqldemo.src} alt="A rocketship in space." />

## Highlights

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Do not restrict the use of SQL">
    You dont need to learn any new query language, you can use SQL with all its
    power and expressiveness.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Automatic CRUD generation">
    Typesql generates CRUD operations for the tables you specify.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Support for nested query result">
    You can get nested results for your queries.
  </Card>
  <Card title="No runtime dependency">
    TypeSQL is used only during development time, the queries are exected using
    the battle tested mysql2 driver.
  </Card>
